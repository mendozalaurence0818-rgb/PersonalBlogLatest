          <h2>Childhood Story</h2>
          <p>
            <sup>1</sup>I went to three different schools when I was a kid.

            <sup>2</sup>I studied preschool in a Barangay Hall. <sup>3</sup>I
            transferred to General M. Hizon Elementary School. <sup>4</sup>After
            that, I studied Grade 1 and Grade 2 at Manila Cathedral School.
            <sup>5</sup>Later on, I moved again and finished Grade 3 to Grade 6
            at Holy Heart Christian Academy. <sup>6</sup>I was a normal student
            who tried my best every day. <sup>7</sup>Medyo nahihirapan akong mag
            focus sa lessons minsan. <sup>8</sup>Pero kahit ganon, okay pa rin
            ang mga grades ko. <sup>9</sup>I would describe myself as a mid-tier
            student who just wanted to pass and learn. <sup>10</sup>I did not go
            outside a lot when I was young. <sup>11</sup>Since we lived in a
            building, I spent most of my time inside our unit. <sup>12</sup>I
            became very close to my computer because it was my main source of
            fun. <sup>13</sup>Mahilig talaga ako maglaro, manood, at mag-explore
            sa PC. <sup>14</sup>One big memory I have is when my foot got stuck
            in a bike wheel. <sup>15</sup>That accident left a scar that I still
            see today. <sup>16</sup>It hurt a lot. I did not have a phone during
            my childhood years. <sup>17</sup>I only got my first phone when I
            reached Grade 7. <sup>18</sup>My childhood was simple but full of
            small stories. <sup>19</sup>Even though I stayed indoors most of the
            time, I still learned many things. <sup>20</sup>Looking back, those
            years helped shape who I am now.

          <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
          <p>
            <sup>1</sup>Most of my teenage years were spent at home because
            COVID-19 hit hard. <sup>2</sup>Everything suddenly went online and
            life felt very different. <sup>3</sup>Before the pandemic, my Grade
            7 and Grade 8 years were still face-to-face. <sup>4</sup>I had my
            first girlfriend when I was fifteen. <sup>5</sup>I was still a teen,
            but I learned a lot from that relationship. <sup>6</sup>We broke up
            in the middle of the pandemic. <sup>7</sup>After that, I started
            focusing on MLBB to distract myself. <sup>8</sup>I also slowly began
            my editing career during this time. <sup>9</sup>My MLBB journey
            started strong and exciting. <sup>10</sup>My friends and I created
            our own team and organization, we grew fast and joined many
            tournaments. <sup>11</sup>Eventually, our team started to fade
            because people became busy. <sup>12</sup>I then thought of hosting
            tournaments that were free to join but had prizes up to one thousand
            pesos. I became the main person in our group. <sup>13</sup>I was the
            editor and the streamer for every tournament game. <sup>14</sup>I
            also handled the format and flow of each event. <sup>15</sup>Later
            on,<em
              >I got my first official job as a Graphics Designer at Rei
              Esports.<sup>16</sup>The pay was good and the experience was even
              better.<sup>17</sup>During this time,<strong
                >I worked for Z4 Esports, which was handled by Zapnu.

                <sup>18</sup>I also worked with Blackdime PH, ONIC PH, and
                Blacklist International. <sup>19</sup>I even became the official
                Graphics Designer for Sensui, Coach Jeff, and Coach Bam.

            <sup>20</sup>I eventually had to quit because face-to-face classes
            were coming back during my SHS years.

          <h2>College Experience</h2>
          <p>
            <sup>1</sup>My first month in college was exciting because I met a
            group of fifteen friends. <sup>2</sup>Over time, our group slowly
            got smaller. <sup>3</sup>Now, only five of us remain and we are
            still close. <sup>4</sup>I chose BSIT because I first tried HTML
            back in JHS and SHS. <sup>5</sup>We coded using Notepad, and I found
            it very interesting. <sup>6</sup>I also learned that IT was in
            demand, which made me more curious. <sup>7</sup>Even though coding
            is hard for me, I still want to improve. <sup>8</sup>I sometimes
            struggle to listen during lessons. <sup>9</sup>Because of that,
            learning feels slow but still possible. <sup>10</sup>I am not very
            good at coding yet, but I am trying. <sup>11</sup>Every semester
            teaches me something new. <sup>12</sup>There are days when I feel
            stressed, but I keep going. <sup>13</sup>My main goal is to graduate
            and become better. <sup>14</sup>I want to build skills that will
            help me in the future. <sup>15</sup>College has pushed me to be more
            responsible. <sup>16</sup>I also decided to join an organization to
            grow more. <sup>17</sup>Joining UE Zenith Esports turned out to be a
            great choice. <sup>18</sup>I met new people who motivated me.

            <sup>19</sup>I worked hard to prove myself inside the org. Now, I am
            the

            <em>
              <b> EVP for Media Communications in UE Zenith Esports. </b>
            </em>

            <sup>20</sup>This role helps me grow and gives me confidence for my
            future career.
